## Extended Kalman Filter Project

In this project I have utilized a kalman filter to estimate the state of a moving object of interest with noisy lidar and radar measurements

### Compiling
Command `cmake .. && make` from `build` directory works as expected and produces the `ExtendedKF` and `Tests` executables:

```
term01:build user$ ls
CMakeCache.txt		CMakeFiles		ExtendedKF		Makefile		Tests			cmake_install.cmake
```

### Accuracy
RMSE for `x`, `y`, `vx`, `vy` is lower than the corresponding upper bounds of `[.11, .11, 0.52, 0.52]`.

### Correct Algorithm
Prediction and measurement update logic is clearly outlined in [kalman_filter.cpp](src/kalman_filter.cpp). There are two different update functions - one for Linear Kalman Filter and another for Extended Kalman Filter. Thus the filter can accommodate both laser and radar measurements.

The first measurement, whether it is from laser or radar is used to initialize the filter state variable.

### Code Efficiency
The code in [kalman_filter.cpp](src/kalman_filter.cpp) computes the residual, both in the linear and non-linear case and then updates the state and uncertainty variables using the residual vector and the Kalman gain matrix.

## Build Instructions

This project involves the Term 2 Simulator which can be downloaded [here](https://github.com/udacity/self-driving-car-sim/releases)

This repository includes two files that can be used to set up and install [uWebSocketIO](https://github.com/uWebSockets/uWebSockets) for either Linux or Mac systems. For windows you can use either Docker, VMware, or even [Windows 10 Bash on Ubuntu](https://www.howtogeek.com/249966/how-to-install-and-use-the-linux-bash-shell-on-windows-10/) to install uWebSocketIO. Please see [this concept in the classroom](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/16cf4a78-4fc7-49e1-8621-3450ca938b77) for the required version and installation scripts.

Once the install for uWebSocketIO is complete, the main program can be built and run by doing the following from the project top directory.

1. mkdir build
2. cd build
3. cmake ..
4. make
5. ./ExtendedKF

Tips for setting up your environment can be found [here](https://classroom.udacity.com/nanodegrees/nd013/parts/40f38239-66b6-46ec-ae68-03afd8a601c8/modules/0949fca6-b379-42af-a919-ee50aa304e6a/lessons/f758c44c-5e40-4e01-93b5-1a82aa4e044f/concepts/23d376c7-0195-4276-bdf0-e02f1f3c665d)

Note that the programs that need to be written to accomplish the project are [FusionEKF.cpp](src/FusionEKF.cpp), [FusionEKF.h](src/FusionEKF.h), [kalman_filter.cpp](src/kalman_filter.cpp), [kalman_filter.h](src/kalman_filter.h), [tools.cpp](src/tools.cpp), and [tools.h](src/tools.h)

The program `main.cpp` has already been filled out.

Here is the main protcol that `main.cpp` uses for `uWebSocketIO` in communicating with the simulator.


INPUT: values provided by the simulator to the c++ program

`["sensor_measurement"]` => the measurement that the simulator observed (either lidar or radar)


OUTPUT: values provided by the c++ program to the simulator

`["estimate_x"]` <= kalman filter estimated position x
`["estimate_y"]` <= kalman filter estimated position y
`["rmse_x"]`
`["rmse_y"]`
`["rmse_vx"]`
`["rmse_vy"]`
